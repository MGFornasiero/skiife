# **App Name**: KataFlow

## Core Features:

- Sequenza Selection: Display available sequenze in a dropdown menu, populated with the keys of the Sequenze dictionary (1 to 2 in this case).
- Passaggio Display: Upon selecting a sequenza, display each passaggio within it in a structured format (row), including 'movement', 'tecnica', 'Stand', and 'Target'.
- Tabbed Navigation: Two tabbed views: 'Ordinali' and 'Segnaposto'. Only 'Ordinali' is functional in this MVP, displaying the structured Kata sequences. The 'Segnaposto' tab is a placeholder.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey discipline and focus, like a martial arts uniform.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) for a clean and calm learning environment.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFAB40) to highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) provides a modern yet readable look for the descriptions.
- Use a clear, tabular layout for displaying the 'Passaggio' details, ensuring readability.
